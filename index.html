    <h2><li>Summary</h2></li>
     <p>My name is Zola. I am an aspiring web developer. During my yaers in high school, I enjoyed math classes and technical drawing classes known as EGD. I wasn't into computer related subject because I didn't knew that I like them. That interest I discovered it when I was in university doing my 2nd year.I wanted to change majors but my mother wouldn't let me. So I continued with the one I was studying.</p>
     <p>In university, I was studying construction management and quantity surveying. It wasn't a bad major but I didn't find it interesting to study. I feel like i wasted my time with it. I got into it because in high school i studied subject tailored to construction (Civil Technology). </p>
